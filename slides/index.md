## What Are We Talking About?

- The current state of documentation
- How other projects do documentation
- What we can learn from them

----------

## The 5 minute version

_Thesis:_ Drupal documentation could be improved by subjecting it to a set of standards, guidelines, and oversight in a similar way to how Drupal core development is governed.

----------

## What Is Documentation?

- [api.drupal.org](http://api.drupal.org)
- [Handbook](https://www.drupal.org/documentation)
- [Change records](https://www.drupal.org/list-changes)

Note: There are currently a few differen "types" of documentation. API, Handbook, Change records.

========

## Current Priorities

- D8 handbook documentation - [#d8docs](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search?status[]=Open&issue_tags=d8docs)
- Follow/Subscribe to pages and be notified when they change - [#2218551](https://www.drupal.org/node/2218551)
- Introduce concept of maintainers for documentation pages/sections - [#2332855](https://www.drupal.org/node/2332855)
- Better relationship between documentation pages, and issues that track the work that needs to be done on them.- [#995292](https://www.drupal.org/node/995292)
- Complete list of [DocsWG Goals](https://www.drupal.org/governance/docwg-goals)

========

## Pain Points

- Curation, review, and oversight
- Organization and hierarchy when anyone can create a new page anywhere, it's chaos.
- Discoverability - people actually memorize URLs on d.o. to find what they are looking for!
- Versioning
- Translation
- Contributing to docs isn't as sexy as contributing code
- Documentation is thankless

========

## The Awesome

Notes: Things that are currently working well, identified because any changes should seek to preserve these things as best as possible.

========

## Questions I Wish We Could Answer

- Who is responsible for keeping this page up-to-date?
- When does a documentation issue block a core release?

# Case Study: WordPress

========

## WordPress

- Replacing Community Wiki with Edited Guides
- Codex is a behemoth community wiki full of outdated content that anyone can edit or contribute to.
- Handbooks are guides created by the docs team that goes through a full editorial process and are continuously reviewed and updated
- They are in the process of replacing Codex with Handbooks

========

## Main Take-aways

- Core group of volunteers works on guides
- Meetings, progress, and updates are transparently communicated on their doc team public blog. You can see what is being worked on now, what is complete, and what is planned for the future.
- More accurate and helpful docs mean higher community satisfaction with project documentation.
- In some cases employers pay for part-time (half-time) dedicate work of documentation team members

# Case Study: Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)

========

## Defining Pathways for Contributors and Learners

- Learning Pathways for newbies, intermediate and advanced learners
- Extensive documentation for docs contributors
- Various roles and responsibilities available for content experts
- Style guides, how-tos, contributor roles and activities all clearly documented and organized

========
<!-- .slide: data-background="#FF0F19" -->

## Main Take-aways

- Extensive documentation for documentation contributors has resulted in consistently high quality documentation. MDN is one of the highest reputed and trusted sources of documentation for web developers on the Internet.
- Creating roles and responsibilities for contribution mentors and content experts means that contributors receive support and guidance and docs get the attention they need.

----------

# Proposals / Ideas / Better Making

========

Define what AWESOME looks like 5 years from now.

Note: It might be interesting to see what others think. One way to do this would be a writing excercise in which members of the community are asked to write in 2-4 paragraphs what their vision of the future looks like. Might also be intresting to do this ourselves.

========

## Curated Drupal Documentation

- Replace **key portions** of the Drupal.org Handbook with curated documentation
- Create **version dependent** documentation

Note: The idea of curated documentation has been [discussed previously](https://www.drupal.org/node/1291058). There was a [plan for how to make a system for curated documentation](https://www.drupal.org/node/1095012). There was also a [plan to put the Developer docs into the Drupal Core repository](https://www.drupal.org/node/2106873) using Asciidoc. The [Configurable Help Module](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/jhodgdon/2369943), which is currently a Drupal 8 sandbox, allows a module to define one or more help topics as configuration. These topics are imported when the module is enabled, and then can be managed, edited, and viewed within a Drupal site. Topics marked as “top-level” are listed on the admin/help page, and topics can be cross-referenced.

## Challenges

- Change is hard
- Defining scope
- Time / Money / Resourcing
- Ongoing maintenance

----------

## Discuss

- We don't have the answers, but we do recognize that there's a need for change
- Iteration vs. Fresh start

----------

# The End!
