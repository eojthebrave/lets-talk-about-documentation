----------

## What Are We Talking About?

- The current state of documentation
- Changes to Drupal.org that help support documentation
- The Drupal 8 user guide

----------

## What Is Documentation?

- [api.drupal.org](http://api.drupal.org)
- [Handbook](https://www.drupal.org/documentation)
- [Change records](https://www.drupal.org/list-changes)
- [Drupal 8 User Guide](https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide)
- Books, blog posts, videos, etc.

Note: There are currently a few different "types" of documentation. API, Handbook, Change records.

----------

## The Awesome

- api.drupal.org
- Change records
- Drive by editing
- Getting better at recognizing contributions

Any changes we make should seek to preserve our existing strengths.

Note: Things that are currently working well, identified because any changes should seek to preserve these things as best as possible.

## It could be better

<img src="../images/docs-contributors-graph.jpg" alt="Graph" title="Graph" />

----------

Documentation is designed to help move Drupal.org users from [one skill level to the next](https://www.drupal.org/personas), by enabling them to successfully build, maintain, and improve Drupal sites and Drupal itself.

<img src="../images/personas.png" width="60%" alt="Graph" title="Graph" />

Note: Changes to d.o. and docs tools are generally made with Skilled > Expert in mind.

----------

## Pain Points

- Lack of curation, review, and oversight
- Organization and hierarchy when anyone can create a new page anywhere, it's chaos.
- Discoverability - people actually memorize URLs on d.o. to find what they are looking for!
- Versioning
- Translation
- Contributing to docs isn't as sexy as contributing code

----------

## Current Priorities

- D8 user facing documentation - [#d8docs](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search?status[]=Open&issue_tags=d8docs)
- Follow/Subscribe to pages and be notified when they change - [#2218551](https://www.drupal.org/node/2218551)
- Introduce concept of maintainers for documentation pages/sections - [#2332855](https://www.drupal.org/node/2332855)
- Better relationship between documentation pages, and issues that track the work that needs to be done on them.- [#995292](https://www.drupal.org/node/995292)
- [Drupal 8 User Guide](https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide)
- Complete list of [DocsWG Goals](https://www.drupal.org/governance/docwg-goals)

----------

## Updating Drupal.org

- Create groups/sections of documentation
- Sections can have one or more maintainers
- Relate documentation to projects

----------

## More on Drupal.org Updates

- Session: [Content Strategy for Drupal.org](https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2015/sessions/content-strategy-drupalorg)
- [[META] Structure Drupal.org content around areas of user activity](https://www.drupal.org/node/2481515)
- [Content model for Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/2481519)

----------

## Lets Talk Documentation

[DrupalCon LA Session](https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/sessions/lets-talk-about-documentation)

- WordPress and MDN case studies
- Much discussion
- Drupal 8 User Guide

----------

## Curated Drupal Documentation

- Replace **key portions** of the Drupal.org Handbook with curated documentation
- Create **version dependent** documentation

Note: The idea of curated documentation has been [discussed previously](https://www.drupal.org/node/1291058). There was a [plan for how to make a system for curated documentation](https://www.drupal.org/node/1095012). There was also a [plan to put the Developer docs into the Drupal Core repository](https://www.drupal.org/node/2106873) using Asciidoc. The [Configurable Help Module](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/jhodgdon/2369943), which is currently a Drupal 8 sandbox, allows a module to define one or more help topics as configuration. These topics are imported when the module is enabled, and then can be managed, edited, and viewed within a Drupal site. Topics marked as “top-level” are listed on the admin/help page, and topics can be cross-referenced.
