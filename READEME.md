Good documentation is important to the success of Drupal as a product and Drupal as a community. For many people it's their first introduction to both the Drupal codebase and the Drupal community. Over the years the documentation available on drupal.org has grown, and expanded, and then grown some more. But our tools, policies, and processes for maintaining it haven't always kept up with that unchecked growth. So how can we as a community update the way we do documentation to make it as well structured, thought out, and maintained as the code base it seeks to document?

We'll provide an outline of the current state of documentation on drupal.org, as we see it. As well as identify some of the issues we think are holding back progress. We've got ideas about how to fix some of them and we'll share those for sure. In other cases we can see a problem, but possible solutions continue to elude us. That's where you come in, if you had a magic wand how would you change documentation?

Things we'll cover include but are not limited to:  

- Time, money, and their impact on quality
- Curation and page/section ownership
- Ongoing maintenance of existing pages
- Examples of other projects we think have outstanding documentation that we can learn from

Objectives:

- Outline the current state of documentation on Drupal.org and existing initiatives and proposals to improve it
- Encourage conversation amongst the community around the improvement of documentation
- Share some of our ideas about how to improve the documentation and surrounding processes
